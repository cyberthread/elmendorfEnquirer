# Elmendorf Enquirer
The content included in this repository is for a Faux newspaper titled the Elmendorf Enquirer. The newspaper is imagined as a regional paper located in Anchorage, Alaska with a population of just under 300,000 people. The newspaper is non-partisan and focused on delivering balanced news coverage grounded in facts. The newspaper recently aquired a few smaller local papers and has hired your company to do a redesign of their page templates in preparation for a shift to a new content management system. They've requested a solution that is:
- highly readable across screen sizes
- accessible and inclusive
- flexible and works with a variety of content
- designed with their aging population in mind
- perceived as contemporary and trustworthy

The content incluced in this repository is fake and was written specifically to allow beginning web design students the opportunity to focus on accessible design rather than the development of written content for their first web project. These materials were developed with funding support from [Teach Access](https://teachaccess.org/initiatives/faculty-grants/).

## Faux Client Project
This assignment will be completed collaboratively with a small multi-disciplinary team. The project will be worked on iteratively using an agile design process where each sprint will have its own goals, specifications, and deliverables.

The project is modeled on how an in-house design team or a software company might operate so that you are able to:
- Practice working in an agile framework;
- Explore different roles in the development of a website;
- Break large design tasks into smaller parts;
- Design and build components using HTML5 and CSS3;
- Practice and refine documentation and communication skills;
- Work with an existing brand.
